# Autonomous Vehicle Simulation â€“ Path Planning & Obstacle Avoidance

A simulation-based project demonstrating basic autonomous vehicle behavior using path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms.

## ðŸš— Project Overview

This simulation models a vehicle navigating a 2D environment with static obstacles. The vehicle detects obstacles and dynamically adjusts its path to reach a target location using efficient path planning strategies.

## ðŸ§  Core Features

- **Path Planning** using algorithms like A*
- **Obstacle Detection & Avoidance** in a simulated environment
- **Dynamic Route Recalculation** on encountering new obstacles
- Visualization of path, obstacles, and vehicle movement

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Matplotlib / Pygame / OpenCV** (for visualization)
- **NumPy**
